// # Comments

// ## Single-line Comments

// You can comment in your code using //, so it is easier for you to review the code later.

// Example,

// ```dbml
   // order_items refer to items from that order
// ```

// ## Multi-line Comments

// You can also put comment spanning multiple lines in your code by putting inside /* and */.

// Example,

// ```dbml
/*
    This is a
    Multi-lines
    comment
*/
// ```
